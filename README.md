# Water Usage Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at analyse water usage based on Country and years of usage measurements related to water sanitation and hygiene.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Water Sanitation and Hygiene** dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about water usage, sanitation facilities, and hygiene practices across various regions.

You can access the dataset [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/water-sanitation-and-hygiene/data).

### Dataset Features:
- Water usage statistics
- Geographic regions
- Year of measurement

## Libraries and Tools

The project makes use of the following libraries and tools:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Plotly Express**: For amp visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the process interactively

## Process Overview

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- The data was collected from the Kaggle dataset linked above.
- **Missing values** were handled by imputation.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data was analyzed to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships.
- Visualizations such as histograms, maps and barplots were used to gain insights.
